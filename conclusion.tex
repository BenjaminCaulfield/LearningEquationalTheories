In this paper, we have discussed the problem of learning presentations of equational theories through ground examples and queries. 
We presented polynomial-time algorithms for learning presentations of non-collapsing shallow equational theories. 
It remains open whether these techniques can be extended to learning shallow theories that include collapsing equations.
The definition of MGSEs can be extended to include signatures of a single variable (e.g., $\ang{f,x} \approx \ang{x}$).
This allows for many of the results of this paper to be extended to all shallow theories.
However, it is not clear whether a bound can be established on the number of essential classes that must appear at depth 1 of any presentation of a shallow theory.
This may be investigated in future work.
